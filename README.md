# Mapping_Earthquakes

---
## Overview:
---

In this project we created an interactive map using Leaflet.js library along with Javascript and HTML to retrieve and visualize Earthquake Data from a GeoJSON file. In our visualization we displayed differences in scale of earthquakes across the globe of the last seven days. The Javascript program we created allowed for us to pull GeoJSON data from the USGS website through the D3.js library in order to acquire the features of an earthquake such as coordinates and magnitude. The Leaflet library allowed us to then plot the data on a Mapbox styled map and make it interactive by including an assortment of different base map styles such as Satellite, Streets, and Dark Navigation views and earthquake layers such as Tectonic Plates, Earthquake Magnitude and location information. The visual customizations can all be toggled on and off as the user sees fit.
